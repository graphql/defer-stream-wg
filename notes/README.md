for a meeting? Sign up for the next session!

Notes files mirror the file structure of the agendas; namely they should be in
`YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files to match the date that the meeting took place.

All notes files should begin with the following format:

```md
# GraphQL Incremental Delivery WG Notes - <Month> <Year>

## Agenda

<Copy of agenda section in agenda file>
```

When adding notes: use H2 (`##`) to indicate new topics, use bullet points to
track discussion, try and keep track of who said each thing, and keep in mind
this is not a transcription - everything is assumed to be
paraphrased/simplified. When inserting meta-notes (notes on the notes), use
curly braces to avoid conflicts with markdown - e.g. `{inaudible}`,
`{could not keep up with discussion}`, or `{time - 22:03}`

It's beneficial to insert timestamps periodically throughout the notes as it
allows for easier lookup of the discussion in the video on YouTube.

Actions should be recorded in the following format:

```
- <Speaker>: **ACTION - <assignee>**: <assignment>
```

For example:

- Lee: **ACTION - Benjie** Write an implementation in GraphQL.js

Sometimes ACTIONS are inferred rather than explicit, try and write down the
inferred action as best you can - it's okay to omit the speaker, the critical
thing is to have an assignee and a brief description of the assignment.

Sometimes actions are on everyone; in these cases `**ACTION - everyone**` is
appropriate, but when filing the action item it should be assigned on GitHub to
the champion for that topic.
