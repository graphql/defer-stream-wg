# GraphQL Incremental Delivery Working Group

This working group is a subcommittee of the
[GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) with the
following primary purpose:

> To design and draft an "incremental delivery" enhancement to the GraphQL
> specification.

Anyone in the public GraphQL community may attend a meeting of this
subcommittee, provided they first sign the
[Specification Membership Agreement](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/membership)
or belong to an organization which has signed.

This repository holds [agendas](./agendas) and [notes](./notes) for all meetings
past and upcoming as well as [shared RFC documents](./rfcs). Anyone may edit an
upcoming event's agenda to _attend_ or _propose an agenda item_.

All meetings occur via video conference, however participating company offices
are welcome to host guests.

Meetings are typically scheduled every Monday at 7am Pacific Time. Check the
[agendas](./agendas) for the exact date and time of upcoming meetings.

(maintained in UTC because time zones are hard).

This repo is used by the individuals working on the GraphQL defer/stream spec
proposal and the Incremental Delivery GraphQL-over-http proposal. GitHub
discussions will be used to document architectural decisions made by this group
and to gather feedback and discussions on this proposal.

## New to defer/stream?

The easiest way to learn about the defer/stream directives is to
[read the RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md).

## Want to help us keep up?

We're always looking for volunteers to help take notes from the meetings, the
results of which are shared in [`notes/`](./notes). If you're interested in
taking notes, sign up for a meeting in [`agendas/`](./agendas) and indicate that
you're willing to be a note taker.

## Participation guidelines

Meetings with many participants, especially over video, can easily get hard to
follow or run off course. When we talk about issues we care about, it's easy to
get into heated debate. In order to respect everyone's time, and arrive to
worthwhile outcomes, this subcommittee follows the
["Participation guidelines" in the GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/README.md#participation-guidelines);
a summary of which is:

- Participate
- Don't talk too much
- Volunteer to take notes
- Have an outcome in mind
- Contribute
- Choose your battles
- Champion alternatives
- Block progress as a last resort
- Be patient and persistent
